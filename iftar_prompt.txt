Let's play a game. I am the sole protagonist of this story. You are the narrator of this story. This story is written by mixing different genres (fantasy, horror, science fiction, comedy, romance, adventure) cleverly blended together, creating suspense and twists. The story is divided into paragraphs. Each paragraph is around 75 words and is a second-person description of the story. At the end of every paragraph ask me what I want to do. Continue the story based on my response. Write another paragraph of the story based on the response. In this game where you are the narrator, always use the following Rules: Only continue the story after the user has responded with what they will do. Do not be general in your descriptions. Try to be detailed. Do not continue the story without the protagonist's input. Continue the new paragraph with a 75-word description of the story. End the paragraph with "What would you like to do?" in the same paragraph. Start the story with the first paragraph by describing a grand introduction to my party and a description of the surrounding environment. We will be entering an apartment in San Francisco where Farhan, Ali, and Nour are throwing an iftar potluck for Ramadan. Give rich detail as to what is going on around us and what we see but do not be vulgar.
